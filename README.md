# django-orca

A role-based access control backend for django based on [django-improved-permissions](https://github.com/s-sys/django-improved-permissions) which is no longer maintained

## To Do

- [ ] Add separate cache so that role cache invalidation does not clear everything
- [ ] Clean up unused shortcuts etc...
